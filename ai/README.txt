    Help me create Junit4 test
    Prompt : can you help me create junit4 test, explain to me what should I do and the logic behind it
    Result:
    I'd be happy to help you create JUnit 4 tests! Let me explain the fundamentals and walk you through the process.
    What is JUnit 4?
    JUnit 4 is a testing framework for Java that helps you write and run automated tests. It allows you to verify that your code behaves as expected by testing individual methods or classes in isolation.
    Basic Structure and Logic
    The testing logic follows this pattern:

    Arrange - Set up the test data and conditions
    Act - Execute the method you want to test
    Assert - Verify the result matches your expectations

    Key JUnit 4 Annotations

    @Test - Marks a method as a test case
    @Before - Runs before each test method (setup)
    @After - Runs after each test method (cleanup)
    @BeforeClass - Runs once before all tests in the class
    @AfterClass - Runs once after all tests in the class
    @Test(expected = Exception.class) - Tests that an exception is thrown

    Basic Example
    Let's say you have a simple Calculator class:
    javapublic class Calculator {
        public int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }

        public int divide(int a, int b) {
            if (b == 0) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero");
            }
            return a / b;
        }
    }
    Here's how you'd test it:
    javaimport org.junit.Test;
    import org.junit.Before;
    import static org.junit.Assert.*;

    public class CalculatorTest {
        private Calculator calculator;

        @Before
        public void setUp() {
            calculator = new Calculator();
        }

        @Test
        public void testAdd() {
            // Arrange
            int a = 5;
            int b = 3;

            // Act
            int result = calculator.add(a, b);

            // Assert
            assertEquals(8, result);
        }

        @Test
        public void testDivide() {
            int result = calculator.divide(10, 2);
            assertEquals(5, result);
        }

        @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
        public void testDivideByZero() {
            calculator.divide(10, 0);
        }
    }
    Common Assert Methods

    assertEquals(expected, actual) - Values are equal
    assertTrue(condition) - Condition is true
    assertFalse(condition) - Condition is false
    assertNull(object) - Object is null
    assertNotNull(object) - Object is not null
    assertSame(expected, actual) - Same object reference

    Best Practices

    Test method naming: Use descriptive names like testAddPositiveNumbers() or shouldThrowExceptionWhenDividingByZero()
    One assertion per test: Focus each test on one specific behavior
    Test edge cases: Test boundary conditions, null values, empty collections, etc.
    Independent tests: Each test should be able to run independently

    What would you like to test?
    To help you create specific tests, could you share:

    What class or methods you want to test?
    Any particular scenarios or edge cases you're concerned about?

    I can then help you write targeted JUnit 4 tests with the appropriate setup and assertions!
